Parallel-in-time integration present also at the [SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra.](http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/siam-ala18/Minisymposia.php)

Thanks to Xiao-Chuan Cai and Hans De Sterck for putting together a mini symposium on *iterative solvers for parallel-in-time integration* at SIAM ALA 2018 in Hong Kong. After PinT [being present](/events/2016/12/23/siamcse-ms.html) in all SIAM PP and SIAM CSE conferences since 2013, including this yearâ€™s [SIAM Parallel Processing 2018](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=63542), this is the first time it features prominently at SIAM ALA.
