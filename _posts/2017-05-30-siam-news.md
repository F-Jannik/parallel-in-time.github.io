In the current issue of SIAM News (Volume 50, Number 04, May 2017), parallel-in-time integration was mentioned in the research article "[Climate Predictions, Exascale Computing, and Time Parallelism](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/climate-prediction-exascale-computing-and-time-parallelism)"" by Paul Davis.
Based on Beth Wingate's [plenary talk](/events/2016/07/19/siamcse.html) at SIAM CSE 2017, he discusses opportunities, challenges and first results, in particular with respect to climate simulations.
