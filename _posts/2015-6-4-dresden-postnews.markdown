Successful 4th Workshop on Parallel-in-Time Integration in Dresden, Germany.

<!--more-->
The 4th Dresden turned out to be another great event in the ''Parallel-in-time integration'' workshop series: With 40 participants from 9 different countries, this workshop again provided a lively forum for many interesting discussions around a great many different aspects of PINT. With several well-known researchers from the climate and atmospheric science community present, fascinating discussions emerged about the feasibility of using parallel-in-time integration methods in climate simulations and numerical weather prediction.

Moreover, in order to support the continuation of the workshop series, [a set of bylaws](/events/bylaws.html) has been put in place and the first election of a scientific committee will take place within four weeks after the workshop.

Certainly, everybody is now looking forward to the [5th workshop](/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html) in the series  in November 2016 in Canada.
