This is just an example of a news entry matching various categories.
This first paragraph is just the teaser.

This second paragraph is the more detailed content.

You just write simple [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 
with all the fancy [Octopress Plugins](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/plugins/) 
enabled.

In addition you can embed any [GitHub]() repository via

    {% raw %}{% githubrepo username/reponame %}{% endraw %}

Example:

{% githubrepo Parallel-in-Time/parallel-in-time.github.io %}
