Plans for a proposal for a PINT mini symposium at SIAM PP 2016 in Paris.

<!--more-->
With mini symposia related to parallel-in-time integration at [SIAM CSE 2013](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=15471) in Boston, [SIAM PP 2014](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=17906) in Savannah, [SIAM CSE 2015](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=19996) in Salt Lake City and an invited talk by Rob Falgout also at [SIAM CSE 2015](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/1043/sections/1256), the topic has been well represented at SIAM conferences in the last years.

To continue these efforts, a proposal for a mini symposium on *parallel-in-time integration methods* for the upcoming [SIAM PP 2016](http://www.siam.org/meetings/pp16/) (April 12-15, 2016) in Paris is in the planning stage. If you would like to contribute to the mini symposium with a presentation, please contact one of the organisers:

- Martin Schreiber, [University of Exeter](http://www.parallelintime.org/groups/uoe.html)
- Tobias Neckel, TU Munich
- Daniel Ruprecht, [USI Lugano](/groups/usi.html)

The deadline for proposals is in September, so the list of speakers will have to be finalised towards the end of August.
