[Ben Ong](http://mathgeek.us/) set up a template for writing the PinT benchmark proposal, see [PinT @ GitHub](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/benchmark_suite_proposal).

Based on the open questions session at the [5th PinT Workshop](/events/5th-pint-workshop/), there is now a template for writing short paragraphs on one (or more) of the 10 benchmark problems the community has identified.
The LaTeX files can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/benchmark_suite_proposal).
The repository also contains information on how to participate.
