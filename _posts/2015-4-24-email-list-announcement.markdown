There exists now an email list to help you send and receive information and announcements all around parallel-in-time integration. To join, simply send an email to *parallelintime-subscribe[AT]googlegroups.com* and wait for one of the moderators to approve your request. 

**Note:** You do *not* need a Google account in order to join this list, just send the subscribe email from the email address you want to subscribe.
