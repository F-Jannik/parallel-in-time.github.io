JSC has an open position for a [postdoc](http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dna/2017-288-EN-JSC.html) in the field of parallel-in-time integration methods!

<!--more-->

JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre is looking to recruit a postdoc in the
field of mathematics and/or scientific computing with a special focus on
parallel-in-time integration methods.

The goal of this project is the analysis and adjustment of the parallel
full approximation scheme in space and time ("PFASST") for hyperbolic
problems. A close collaboration with our partners at RWTH Aachen
University (Germany) and University of Leeds (UK) is intended.

Candidates should hold a university degree in the field of mathematics
or scientific computing, followed by a doctoral degree. They should have
profound knowledge of iterative methods, numerical ODE solvers and
hyperbolic problems as well as a strong expertise in C++ or Python
programming. Social competence and good communication skills for
collaborative work in and with interdisciplinary teams are essential.

The project runs for 2 years (further project proposals are planned) and
should start **as soon as possible**. For more information and to apply, please see [here](http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Stellenangebote/_common/dna/2017-288-EN-JSC.html).
