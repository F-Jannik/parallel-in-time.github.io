Following the [bylaws](/events/bylaws.html) put in place during the workshop in Dresden in May 2015, the election of a scientific committee for the PINT workshop series is now underway. Everyone who was officially registered for one of the last three workshops (Manchester, Jülich or Dresden) is eligible to cast a vote and should have received a corresponding email from the helios online voting system.

In case you were registered for one of those workshops but *did not receive an email*, please contact Michael Klöppel from the voting committee at michael[DOT]kloeppel[AT]tu-dresden[DOT]de before July 2nd.
