For the next three workshops, [JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre](http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc)
is providing travel support for PhD students working in the field of parallel-in-time integration methods.

<!--more-->

With this commitment, JSC is emphasizing the importance of regular community meetings, in particular for
young scientists working on their PhD thesis. Up to three students per workshop will receive up to EUR 1.500 each
for covering parts of their travel expenses.

The Scientific Committee of the PinT Workshop Series will select the students based on applications.
These should include:

  - a description of their thesis topic ("This is what I'm working on")
  - a letter of motivation ("This is why I should receive the grant")
  - a short description of the group/institute they are affiliated to ("This is where I work")

Also, students traveling to one of the meetings via this grant are expected to present their work either
on a poster or during a talk.

This offer is starting now. Students who would like to apply should write to r.speck@fz-juelich.de.
