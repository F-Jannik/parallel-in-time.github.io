short_desc: German Priority Programme 1648 Software for Exascale Computing
---

The Priority Programme "Software for Exascale Computing" (SPPEXA) addresses 
fundamental research on the various aspects of HPC software, which is 
particularly urgent against the background that we are currently entering the 
era of ubiquitous massive parallelism.

This massive parallelism only, subsumed to the notion of many-core processors 
and their assembly to systems beyond 107 processing units, will smooth the way 
for extreme computing up to exascale, i.e. computations with 1018 floating point 
operations per second and beyond, and the insight resulting from those 
simulations.
Mastering the various challenges related to this paradigm shift from sequential 
or just moderately parallel to massively parallel processing will be the key to 
any future capability computing application at exascale, but it will also be 
crucial for learning how to effectively and efficiently deal with commodity 
systems of the day after tomorrow for smaller-scale or capacity computing 
tasks - and it is the overall scientific objective of SPPEXA.
To this end, SPPEXA re-connects several relevant sub-fields of computer science 
with the needs of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and 
High-Performance Computing (HPC).
SPPEXA provides the framework for a much closer cooperation and a much more 
co-design-driven approach - instead of a merely service-driven collaboration of 
groups focusing on fundamental HPC methodology (computer science or mathematics)
on the one hand with those working on science applications and providing the 
large codes (science and engineering) on the other hand.
Topically, SPPEXA will drive research towards extreme-scale computing in six 
areas or research directions:

  - computational algorithms,
  - system software,
  - application software,
  - data management and exploration,
  - programming,
  - software tools.

Hardware peak performance is ever increasing, exascale systems are currently 
predicted for around 2018, and insight is growing world-wide that a "racks 
without brains" strategy will not allow the science communities to exploit the 
huge potential of the computational approach in a massively parallel world.
Against this background, SPPEXA provides an ideal framework for bundling 
research activities nation-wide and enabling the participating groups to 
significantly advance the state of the art in HPC software technology at an 
international scale.
