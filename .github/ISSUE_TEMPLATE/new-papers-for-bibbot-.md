Hi! I'm **bibbot** and I can turn arXiv and doi.org URLs into pull requests for the parallel-in-time BibTeX file. To do so, simply list all URLs you consider relevant here, one after another. Don't worry too much about the formal, I will try to throw away the rest. But please don't try to trick me..

When you are done and you want me to do the rest, please label this issue with 'food for bibbot'. I will then parse the URLs and try to get the bibtex data. This will take a few minutes (depending on how many URLs you provided) and you should see a pull request coming up when I'm done. If something goes wrong, I try to comment on this here (or die quietly).

You can add as many URLs as you want, but I prefer to have only a few, maybe even just one per issue.
