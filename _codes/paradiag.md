short_desc:  ParaDIAG includes diagonalization-based Parallel-in-Time (PinT) algorithms.
---
 ParaDIAG is a class of Parallel-in-Time (PinT) algorithms based on the diagonalization technique {% cite gander2020paradiag %}. 
 ParaDIAG can handle both the dissipative problems (e.g., the advection-diffusion equations) and 
 the purely wave equations (e.g., the acoustic equation).
