# Fifth Parallel-in-Time Integration Workshop

The Fifth Workshop on Parallel-in-time Integration Workshop will be
held at the [Banff International Research Station (BIRS)][BIRS] from
November 27 to December 2, 2016.  BIRS is located on the campus of the
[Banff Centre][BANFFCENTRE] in the mountain town of [Banff][Banff],
just inside the Canadian Rockies.  BIRS is a relaxed and picturesque
location for focused research and collaboration.

This workshop is the fifth *Parallel-in-time Integration* workshop,
and will build upon the success of the preceding four workshops:

1. Università della Svizzera italiana (Lugano, Switzerland) in 2011
2. Manchester University (Manchester, UK) in 2013
3. Forschungszentrum Jülich (Jülich, Germany) in 2014
4. Technische Universität Dresden (Dresden, Germany) 2015

The central goal of this event is to encourage participants to join
their expertise for their mutual benefit.  Participants in the
workshop will include domain experts in time-parallel, multigrid, and
domain decomposition methods.

The workshop is organised by

1. Matthew Emmett (Computer Modelling Group Ltd.)
2. Martin Gander (Université de Genève)
3. Ronald Haynes (Memorial University of Newfoundland)
4. Rolf Krause (Università della Svizzera italiana)
5. Michael Minion (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory / Stanford University)

in conjunction with the [Parallel-in-Time Scientific Committee][PINTSC].

## Participation

BIRS workshops are by invitation only.  If you would like to attend
the workshop, please contact [Matthew
Emmett](mailto:memmett@gmail.com).

Accommodation and meals are covered by BIRS (yes, room and board are
*free of charge*!).  As such, **participants are expected to cover their
own airfare and transportation costs**, including costs associated with
getting from the [Calgary International Aiport (YYC)][YYC] to BIRS.

We encourage all invited participants to submit an abstract for review
by the scientific by the [Parallel-in-Time Scientific
Committee][PINTSC]. Unfortunately, due to scheduling constraints, it
may not be possible for all participants to give a talk.

**The first round of abstracts are due by March 19 2016.** Abstracts
can be submitted online through [the abstract submission
form][ABSTRACTS] or by emailing them to [Matthew
Emmett](mailto:memmett@gmail.com).

## Proceedings

Participants with accepted abstracts will be invited to publish their
contributions, in the format of a short paper (maximum of 20 pages) in
the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published as a special
issue of **Computing and Visualization in Science** (Springer).

## Scientific Overview

The efficient use of modern high performance computing (HPC) systems
has become one of the key challenges in computational science.  Top
HPC architectures have already attained million-way concurrency, and
current trends suggest that processor counts will continue to grow
rapidly.  Exploiting these levels of parallelism using traditional
techniques for spatial parallelism becomes problematic when, for
example, the problem size per processor shrinks and communication
costs begin to dominate.

This workshop brings together scientists from the fields of
parallel-in-time integration, multigrid methods, and domain
decomposition to discuss similarities between their respective
approaches to space/time algorithms, their applications and,
ultimately, their combination.  Questions arising in this context
range from possible coarsening strategies to suitable inter-level
transfer operators in space and time, and how other features of
time-parallel methods can be exploited to further enhance their
applicability to complex systems.

## Objectives

### Showcase

Recent advances in parallel-in-time integration, in terms of both
theoretical aspects and practical advances, will be showcased by
participants through a series of contributed talks.

### Educate

Our intended participants include young researchers as well as domain
experts in time-parallel, multigrid, and domain decomposition methods.
The workshop will include several hands on sessions to develop
theoretical understanding of the techniques and approaches involved in
these fields and give participants a chance to further explore
opportunities for collaboration.

### Progress

Parallel-in-time integration methods have recently moved from
proof-of-concept to production applications through the development of
several software libraries that implement the MGRIT, Parareal, PFASST,
and RIDC algorithms.  The workshop will include hands on sessions to
walk potential library users through the process of incorporating and
using time-parallel methods in their codes.  Library designers will
also have an opportunity to exchange best-practises, design
principles, pitfalls etc.


## Programme


This 5-day workshop will consist of numerous talks, open discussion
periods, and a few software workshops.

A detailed schedule will eventually be posted on our [PinT@BIRS
2016][PINT16BIRS] website.


## Funding


The organisers and scientific committee would like to thank
[BIRS][BIRS] for graciously hosting the workshop and [AARMS][AARMS]
for further support
