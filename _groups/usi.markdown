Group _High Performance Methods for Numerical Simulation in Science, Medicine and Engineering_.

Members of the group at ICS started working on parallel-in-time methods in the course of the Swiss
_High Performance and High Productivity Computing_ initiative [HP2C](http://www.hp2c.ch).
Research on time-parallel methods is now also part of the [_ExaSolvers_](/projects/sppexa.html)
projects.
