the workshop, please contact [Matthew

Accommodation and meals are covered by BIRS (yes, room and board are
*free of charge*!).  As such, **participants are expected to cover their
own airfare and transportation costs**, including costs associated with
getting from the [Calgary International Aiport (YYC)][YYC] to BIRS.

We encourage all invited participants to submit an abstract for review
by the scientific by the [Parallel-in-Time Scientific
Committee][PINTSC]. Unfortunately, due to scheduling constraints, it
may not be possible for all participants to give a talk.

**The first round of abstracts are due by March 19 2016.** Abstracts
can be submitted online through [the abstract submission
form][ABSTRACTS] or by emailing them to [Matthew
Emmett](mailto:memmett@gmail.com).

## Proceedings

Participants with accepted abstracts will be invited to publish their
contributions, in the format of a short paper (maximum of 20 pages) in
the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published as a special
issue of **Computing and Visualization in Science** (Springer).

## Funding

The organisers and scientific committee would like to thank
[BIRS][BIRS] for graciously hosting the workshop and [AARMS][AARMS]
