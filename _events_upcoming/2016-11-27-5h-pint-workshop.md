The Fifth Workshop on Parallel-in-time Integration Workshop will be
held at the [Banff International Research Station (BIRS)][BIRS] from
November 27 to December 2, 2016.

BIRS is located on the campus of the [Banff Centre][BANFFCENTRE] in
the mountain town of [Banff][Banff], just inside the Canadian Rockies.
BIRS is a relaxed and picturesque location for focused research and
collaboration.

This workshop is the fifth *Parallel-in-time Integration* workshop,
and will build upon the success of the preceding four workshops:

1. Università della Svizzera italiana; Lugano, Switzerland; 2011;
2. Manchester University; Manchester, UK; 2013;
3. Forschungszentrum Jülich; Jülich, Germany; 2014.
4. Technische Universität Dresden; Dresden, Germany; 2015;

The central goal of this event is to encourage participants to join
their expertise for their mutual benefit.  Participants in the
workshop will include domain experts in time-parallel, multigrid, and
domain decomposition methods.

Please see the [PinT@BIRS 2016 website][PINT16BIRS] for more information.
