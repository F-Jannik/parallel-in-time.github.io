In this workshop, we want to address the challenge of large time dependent problems with time parallel methods.
With the emergence of architectures with tens of millions of cores before the end of the decade, current parallelization strategies usually based on parallelization in space, inevitably reach their intrinsic limits.
To use present and forthcoming massive levels of concurrency, additional directions of parallelism are thus required.
For time-dependent problems, time-parallel methods have recently been demonstrated to be a promising approach.
The idea of concurrency in the time domain is attracting growing interest in many different communities ranging from applied mathematics and computer science to climate and earth sciences as well as engineering sciences.
The goal of the workshop is to gather international experts in numerical linear algebra and high-performance computing to present current research trends in this field, and to generate new ideas for future research activities and collaborations.

There are no registration fees for the workshop and full details of how to register will be soon available
